# Parts of Speech Frontend

Parts of Speech is a simple web application that tells a user how many of the eight basic parts of speech are in a block of text.

The parts of speech identified are:
- verbs
- adverbs
- adjectives
- nouns
- pronouns
- articles
- conjunctions
- interjections

This repo contains the frontend for the project.
